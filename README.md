# Web-Starter
A simple website starter for SASS, CSS, HTML etc.. This is my own starter kit for building front-end projects without having to result
to tools like yo or having to go to github to download every single file or worse touch and mkdir everything folder or file.
Build tools are awesome but let's be honest nobody loves writing .gulpfile files because they are not fun.

``` javascript
  npm install gulp gulp-sass gulp-plumber gulp-browserSync gul-autoprexifer
